# TASK:
Having two standards for a keypad layout is inconvenient!
Computer keypad's layout:
```
7 8 9  
4 5 6  
1 2 3  
0 
```

Cell phone keypad's layout:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
0
```

Solve the horror of unstandardized keypads by providing a function that converts computer input to a number as if it was typed on a phone.

Example:
```"789"``` -> ```"123"```

Notes:
You get a string with numbers only
